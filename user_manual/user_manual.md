## Use as Admin
As an administrator, it is your responsibility to initiate the pairing process that is built into the application. To do this, you must first log into the application using your administrator credentials. See the Login section.
1. Click on the 'Dashboard' button on the right side of the navbar, at the top of the webpage, to access the page for pairing students.
2. To the bottom right of this page, you will see three input fields. Each input field has three options: Gender, Course Code and Interests. Order these in any way you feel is appropriate (with no duplicates). The pairing algorithm pairs students based on similarities in these three attributes. By ordering the attributes, you're telling the algorithm to have a heavier bias towards the attributes at the top. For example, if you were to order it as "Gender, Course Code, Interests" (top to bottom), the algorithm would have a higher bias in pairing students that are of the same gender over students with similar interests over students in the same course.
3. Once you're happy with the preferences of the attributes, click the "Match Users" button to begin the pairing process. This process may take some time but please do not close the application or log out until the process finishes.
